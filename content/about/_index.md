description : "At Creative Collab, we're on a mission to nurture the creative spark in every child. Our art classes are designed for budding artists aged 7-10 who are ready to take their passion to the next level!
Picture this: A cozy caf√© transformed into an artistic haven after hours, where creativity comes alive! Upbeat music fills the air, colorful supplies cover the tables, and young artists gather to explore their imaginations. This is where the magic happens!
Our experienced teachers (Tracey Taylor and Katie Pearce) guide students through exciting projects, helping them to create high-quality masterpieces, that they'll be proud to display at home. We're not painting by numbers - we're here to develop real skills and unleash imagination.
What makes us special? We blend top-notch instruction with a fun, inspiring atmosphere. 
Creative Collab is perfect for kids who dream in color. Join us for an unforgettable artistic adventure that will have your child beaming with pride and bursting with creativity!"
